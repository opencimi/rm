CIMI RM
=======
In this repository you will find the different versions and for each version different representations of the CIMI RM and work files.
For each version there will be a folder with that version, using semver.org versioning rules (e.g. 1.0.0-dstu.3).

Folders

<tr><td>/[version]</td><td>Will contain the EAP, BMM, XMI, XSD, RDF representation of <version> of the CIMI RM</td></tr>
