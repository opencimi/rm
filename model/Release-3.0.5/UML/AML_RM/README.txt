Updated: December 4th, 2015

CIMI_RM_v3.0.5.xmi

This file has been created by:

1. Loading the CIMI_RM_v3.0.5.mdzip which containts the latest mini CIMI Reference Model.
2. Open the file in MagicDraw 18.2 version.
3. References to the streotypes of the 'thecustomprofile' were removed.
4. The UML profile 'thecustomprofile' was removed from this MagicDraw Project.
5. Removed the folders specific to Enterprise Architect (staring with EA_...).
6. Top package is renamed to "AML_RM".
7. Made sure there were no errors reported in the MD IDE about the model.
8. Export the MagicDraw project as "UML 2.5 XMI" and saved as "CIMI_RM_v3.0.5.xmi".

Now this file opens fine in both MagicDraw and Eclipse EMF Environment.
